1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - First, create a virtual environment on your local machine. This environment will be used to install and isolate the Python packages required for your Lambda function.
   - Use the following commands in your terminal (for Unix-based systems including Linux and macOS):
     ```bash
     mkdir mylambda
     cd mylambda
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Pandas**:
   - With your virtual environment activated, install pandas using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

3. **Prepare the Deployment Package**:
   - AWS Lambda requires all the necessary code and libraries to be zipped together. Include the entire contents of your virtual environment’s lib site-packages, where pandas and its dependencies are installed. You can find this folder at `venv/lib/python3.X/site-packages/`.
   - Make sure your Lambda function’s handler script is in the root of the zip archive.
   - You can prepare the package using the following commands:
     ```bash
     cd venv/lib/python3.X/site-packages/
     zip -r9 ${OLDPWD}/function.zip .
     cd $OLDPWD
     zip -g function.zip lambda_function.py  # assuming your handler is in lambda_function.py
     ```

4. **Upload the Deployment Package to AWS Lambda**:
   - You can upload this zip file to your Lambda function either through the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-function --zip-file fileb://function.zip
     ```


5. **Use Amazon S3 for Large Deployments

If your deployment package is still too large even after optimization, you can upload the package to an S3 bucket and then deploy your Lambda function from there:

- **Upload to S3**:
  
  ```bash
  aws s3 cp function.zip s3://my-bucket/
  ```

- **Update Function Code from S3**:

  ```bash
  aws lambda update-function-code \
      --function-name MyPythonFunction \
      --s3-bucket my-bucket \
      --s3-key function.zip
  ```

This method allows deployment packages up to 250 MB.
